This section is for informational purposes only. It's technical. It captures the process to create the GitHub Pages [SEFSC-documentation-quarto-skeleton](https://mattgrossi-noaa.github.io/SEFSC-documentation-quarto-skeleton) repository template for use within the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center.

Nothing herein needs to be repeated to create a specific documentation page in a GitHub repository. These steps are *only necessary if one desires to create a new **template*** of the same format and functionality â€“ for example, if a different Financial Management Center (FMC) desires to create their own custom template.

Instructions for creating an actual documentation page using the theme are provided in [Getting started with SEFSC Quarto Documentation Theme Skeleton](https://mattgrossi-noaa.github.io/SEFSC-documentation-jekyll-skeleton/setup.html).
